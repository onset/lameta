    "body": "# Warning\r\n\r\nThis is a PREVIEW release (an \"alpha\"). There are many changes here, and because of a change to how Person languages are modeled (see below), not everything you enter in this version will be retained if you go back to a previous version. For this reason we are putting this out for testing purposes before releasing for the normal \"beta\" testing users.\r\n\r\n# What's New\r\n* This version has a completely new system for recording the languages of people.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8448/96930579-2b995700-1479-11eb-9f65-994f86d19afc.png)\r\n\r\n    * A person can have an unlimited number of languages.\r\n    * You can drag to reorder languages.\r\n    * You can use the \"star\" button next to a language to mean whatever you want, and can star more than one language.\r\n    * You can use the \"mother\" / \"father\" buttons next to a language however you want, and can mark them on more than one language.\r\n* Opening the project file (`.sprj`) will now cause lameta to open that project and automatically open it next time you run lameta. This makes it easier to re-locate your project to a different drive. Just quit lameta, move the project folder, then double-click the `.sprj` file.\r\n* This version has a completely new system for handling copying in of files.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8448/96931256-3bfe0180-147a-11eb-9456-56b092a8fc33.png)\r\n\r\n    * You should now be able to copy in very large videos without problems (previously macs had a 2Gig limit).\r\n    * You can start as many copies going at once as you like, and continue working elsewhere while the copy progresses in the background.\r\n        * lameta will show the status of each file.\r\n        * There is a new \"Copying\" notice to remind you that coping is not done yet.\r\n        * lameta will prevent exporting of IMDI with media files included until all copying is done.\r\n* We've done a lot of work to make it safer to use lameta in a Dropbox context. \r\n    * lameta will now retry file operations if Dropbox or some other synchronization or antivirus program is temporarily locking its files.\r\n* lameta will tell you when you try to copy in something and your hard drive becomes full.\r\n\r\n# Improvements\r\n* We've added a bunch of new helpful messages for the rare cases where things go wrong. For example if you play a video and then try to delete or rename it, often the video player is still locking the file. lameta will now tell you what happened and what to do about it.\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n* Previously, it was sometimes possible to get a folder (session or person) in a partially-renamed state when one of its files was locked by something (e.g. a video player, Dropbox, antivirus, etc.). Now, lameta detects the problem and avoids changing any file names until it can change all of them.\r\n* We did some fixes to localization of contribution roles."

This just adds tabs that show how fields will be mapped if you do a PARADISEC export.\r\n\r\n# Improvements\r\n- Various improvements to PARADISEC export.\r\n- Previously, we had \"Content Languages\" (vs. \"Working Languages\"). This was confusing since some archives use \"Content Language\"\r\n  to mean what language you will hear/read in the record, whereas others use it to mean what record is _about_. This version changes the field to the less ambiguous \"Subject Language\". We welcome feedback about this change.\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed icons that went missing.\r\n- Improved Person Grid labels when there are no people yet.\r\n- Improved handling of missing vernacular language info.\r\n- Fixed some messed up country names.\r\n- Made multi-language fields grow as necessary.\r\n- Gave File explorer more time to run before we quit on Let me Fix This.\r\n\r\n# Known Problem With Large Files on Macs\r\n\r\nOn Macs, lameta has problems copying large files. You may find that some files copy without problems, some may give errors, and some may silently just not copy. Until we have a fix, if you experience this problem, the work-around is copy your video files into the session folder using the Mac Finder. When you restart lameta, it will appear in the session.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\nWindows: lameta-Setup.0.9.1.exe (note that this is not cryptographically \"signed\", so Windows will discourage you from installing it.)\r\nMac: lameta-0.9.1.dmg\r\n"

However, after opening with laMeta, the files will be saved with some small changes that SayMore 3.0 & 3.1 do not understand. You will need to SayMore 3.2 to reopen the project. So of course make a backup before testing out laMeta-beta. But also understand that if you will be wanting to have both SayMore and laMeta both work on the same project, then you need at least SayMore 3.2.\r\n\r\n[Saymore 3.2](https://build.palaso.org/repository/download/bt34/177876:id/SayMoreInstaller.3.2.2291.msi) is also in beta, so really, you need a good backup system.\r\n\r\n## New\r\n\r\nName change from Digame to laMeta.  The first time you run laMeta 0.8.4, it will not know any of your old Digame, SayMoreX, or SayMore settings. But don't panic! Click \"Open Project\", then navigate to where you had your .sprj file.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\nImproved error handling\r\nImproved export directory handling\r\nSeveral IMDI export fixes\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\nWindows: laMeta.Setup.0.8.4.exe (note that this is not cryptographically \"signed\", so Windows will discourage you from installing it.)\r\n\r\nMac: laMeta-0.8.4.dmg\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "This release contains many small improvements.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n\r\n- Added a subtle \"Saving\" notification to help you know that your work is being saved.\r\n- Improved Session and People layouts.\r\n- `Session Setting` and `Situation` have been removed. If you have text in those fields, it will be appended to the Session Description.\r\n- Gender now includes an `Other` option.\r\n- You can now select which sessions to export to CSV or IMDI.\r\n- Now shows a helpful message if you get multiple .session or .person files in a folder\r\n- Now asks where you want to save the export zip.\r\n- Person Primary Language `Learned In` is now labeled `Details`\r\n- Many fields now have tooltips describing their use.\r\n- Some fields now have an a little 🛈 that, when clicked, gives you extra information about using the field.\r\n- Hovering over a Genre choice now lists information about that choice.\r\n- The Genre list now open, so you can add your own.\r\n- The Genre list now includes `elicitation` and `translation`.\r\n- Session `Subgenre` is now a major field.\r\n- Added `Keyword` and `Topic fields to Session.\r\n- When you enter a language name, SayMoreX searches for it and turns it red if cannot be found. The language name can still be exported, but the ISO code for it will be `und`.\r\n- The Session.Continent field now has a list to chose from.\r\n- Leaving a Person Birth Year blank or containing a \"?\" will now be exported to IMDI as \"unknown\".\r\n- Person How to Contact is now flagged as Personally Identifiable information, and is not exported to CSV or IMDI.\r\n- Session `Location` field is now labeled `Neighborhood/Town/Village`.\r\n- `Project Title` is now labelled `Project ID`\r\n- Removed Project `Rights Holder`. It was felt that `Project Contact` & `Depositor` are sufficient.\r\n- There is now a menu choice named `IMDI Mode`. When selected:\r\n  - Fields that ELAR judges as not important for archiving get italic labels.\r\n  - Tabs appear which preview IMDI output of the currently selected session or person.\r\n  - When files are named or renamed, they are made to conform to these characters: [a-Z,0-9,_, -]. Note: existing files are not automatically renamed to conform.\r\n  - The file name dialog will prevent you from entering non-conformant names.\r\n- `Rename for consent` now uses the name of the consultant.\r\n- All dates are now displayed in YYYY-MM-DD format.\r\n- When you drag a file into a Session or Person, it is selected automatically.\r\n\r\nFixes\r\n\r\n- Changing case of a letter in the name adds \"1\"s & detaches the meta data.\r\n- Fixed a problem with renaming a person after adding media files.\r\n- When deleting a media file, its .meta sidecar file was sometimes mistakenly resurrected.\r\n- Now auto saves when you switch to another session/person.\r\n\r\nDownloads\r\n\r\nWindows: SayMore.X.Setup.0.8.0.exe (note that this is not cryptographically \"signed\", so Windows will discourage you from installing it.)\r\nMac: SayMore.X-0.8.0.dmg\r\n"

It has been decided for now that SayMoreX will always display the English name.\r\n\r\nNew Sessions will always have these fields pre-filled with the corresponding languages declared in the Project tab. Existing Sessions, from older versions of SayMore, will also have these filled in.\r\n\r\nIf the project's Content Language doesn't have an official code, it can use a code between qaa and qtz. The name that is given will be used in each session. At this time, it is assumed that such languages won't be the \"Working Language\", but if that's a bad assumption, let us know.\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n\r\nWindows: SayMore.X.Setup.0.7.2.exe (note that this is not cryptographically \"signed\", so Windows will discourage you from installing it.)\r\nMac: Coming soon."

So, \"es\" (ISO 639-1) or \"spa\" (ISO 639-3) or \"español\", but not \"Spanish\". In a future version, we expect to include an index that has a wider number of language name renderings.\r\n\r\nWhen you create a new session, it SayMoreX will automatically give it the Content Language of the Project. However if you open sessions that were created before this version, the Languages field will be empty.\r\n\r\n#### Session People Roles\r\nYou can now list the role of each participant in a session.\r\nAdd people as before, but now, you will see their role underneath their name:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8448/61250356-b935b500-a714-11e9-931d-c26f0c814500.png)\r\n\r\nTo change the role, click on a name or click on the new \"Contributors\" tab:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8448/61250382-c488e080-a714-11e9-974e-07273ecfee05.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n\r\nMac: SayMore.X-0.7.1.dmg\r\nWindows: SayMore.X.Setup.0.7.1.exe (note that this is not cryptographically \"signed\", so Windows will discourage you from installing it.)"
