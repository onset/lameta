description: work on a linear issue
---

We are working on src/export/ROCrate. Tests are at src/export/ROCrate/**tests**. We are constrained by these specs: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Language-Research-Technology/ldac-profile/refs/heads/master/profile/profile.md and https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/structure.

Below, I will give you a url to a linear issue. Look for the last comment. It should @-mention you ("@agent"). Think about the problem, read the comments, and reply to my comment with your own comment. Do this using the linear mcp command "create_comment tool".
